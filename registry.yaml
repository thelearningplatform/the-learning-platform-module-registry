# Schema v1.2 - Runtime Module Serving with Timeout Support
# 
# Required Fields:
# - id: Unique module identifier
# - name: Display name for the module
# - description: Module description
# - repoUrl: GitHub repository URL
# - version: Must be pinned (e.g., "v1.0.0"), not "latest"
# - checksum: SHA256 of module.tar.gz for integrity verification
# - author: Module author identifier
# - authorType: "official" or "community"
# - status: Approval status (e.g., "approved")
# - approvedAt: ISO 8601 timestamp of approval
# - approvedBy: Approver identifier
#
# Optional Fields:
# - releaseUrl: Derived from repoUrl if not specified
# - timeoutMs: Per-module fetch timeout in milliseconds (integer >= 1000)
#              If not specified or set to 0, uses global default (MODULE_REGISTRY_TIMEOUT env var, default 30000ms)
#              Use for modules with larger bundles that may need more time to download
#
# Example with per-module timeout:
#   - id: large-module
#     name: "Large Module"
#     timeoutMs: 60000  # 60 second timeout for large bundle
